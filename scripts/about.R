# About section text
about <- "This is a project created by Mara Childs, Isabel Giang, Nikhila Iyer, and Esha More for Informatics 201 
          at the University of Washington. We were curious about how the temperature is potentially affected by both
          wind speed and cloud coverage. Leveraging the Dark Sky Weather API, we were able to visually display
          trends and correlations. Find more in our Insights tab!

insights <- "From our explorations of this dataset, we discovered several notable trends.
             For instance, higher windspeed was observed to correlate with lower temperature regardless of the
             value of the other observed weather metrics.
             Temperature and wind speed, along with temperature and cloud coverage, were positively correlated.
             In general, the East Coast observed higher amounts of cloud coverage in comparison to the West Coast.  
             Additionally, temperatures seemed to be consistent in value during the morning and evening, while
             widely varying during the daytime and afternoon, regardless of location."
